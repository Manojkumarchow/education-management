College Management System

Backend Design - Basic
1. Users Table
    1. Types of Users
        1. Admin
        2. HOD
        3. Staff / Faculty
        4. Student
2. Student Table
    1. Basic fields
3. Faculty Table
    1. Basic fields
4. Marks Table
    1. Basic fields
Every table in the database should have 4 fields. Created_on, Created_by, Updated_on, Updated_by. These 4 fields will be used for tracking purposes

We will not store any PII data (email, phone, DOB, address) in any of the table as it should be in compliance with many things.

V1 will have very basic things like
	1. User Login
	2. Register Page (User can register with basic things like H.T No or EMP_ID)
	3. Admin/HOD will approve the user access till then registered user cannot login to the application
	4. Faculty can view the student details (initially can view all the student details, we will modify the view access later on)
	5. Student can view his/her class student details (Modify the view access later)
	6. Faculty can download the student details into excel format (we will add the filters in the UI in V2)
	7. Faculty can upload study resources, student can download them (V2)
	8. Upon login, we will have a drop-down on the user image/icon, it will have various options like mark details, fee details, faculty details etc..
	9. We will have a nav bar at the top, that shows Home | News/Events | Contact Details (Home Page needs to be discussed)

Any suggestions?
